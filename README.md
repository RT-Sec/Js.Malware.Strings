# Js.Malware.Strings

### (This is an UNOFFICIAL repository)

This repository is dedicated to the collection any and all possible
javascript malware signatures.

To use this repository with clamAV to scan your javascript source files use:
```
#> git clone https://github.com/majorendian/Js.Malware.Strings.git
#> cd Js.Malware.Strings
#> clamscan -id . -r /path/to/javascript/source/files
```

### Reason for this repo

This repo was created in response to the recent malware threats
that node.js and npm present to developers and regular users
alike. As such, this repo aims to collect as a comprehensive
set of signature databases for use as an addition to already existing
anti-virus databases in the form of .ldb, .ndb and .yara
files.

## Contributing

If you know of, have any javascript malware links/samples that could
be analyzed and added to these databases, feel free to submit
a pull request or open an issue pointing to the offending files(s)

This also includes malicious dependencies, to catch malware before
it is downloaded.
For more information on how, check the "$dep\_node\_ipc" variable
in the yara file


### False negatives

Please report any false negatives you are aware of
if you are using this repo as a supplementary
malware database, by either opening an issue
or submiting a pull request with either
a .yara, .ndb or .ldb files, or possibly
just submiting a modification of the jsmalware.ldb or
jsmalware.yara files

### False positives

Please also report any false positives you stumble upon.
False positives may pop up as a result of an incomplete
defininition for any given malware, due to
an attempt to catch copy-pasted malware as well.


## Future plans

* Separate additional scripts for JS malware detection
* Programs for source code scans during download from
	from node.js package repositories, to catch
	malicious code before it executes
